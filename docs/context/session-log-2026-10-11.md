# Session log 2026-10-11

## Studio states show at once on pages you made (session "Studio nested props", branch zen/feat/nested-overrides, tier S)

- User: committed + pushed 14a9925 (fast path A); TopNavigation keeps its data-item actions; "các state của component
  (ví dụ như row trong table) đổi xong phải refresh trang mới thấy được".
- Reproduced on a builder page (E2E NO-04): Data-Row State → Selected wrote `defaultSelectedIds={["binh"]}` but the
  canvas kept no row selected until a reload. Cause: a builder page renders its parsed tree (no Fast Refresh remount),
  and a component reads `defaultX` into its state once. Example pages were fine (SE-35: their module re-runs).
- Fix: `builder/render/renderPage.tsx` keys an element by its initial-state props (`defaultX`, `initialX`, and those in
  `overrides`), so an edit of one remounts that component only, at once. NO-04 works (selected at once, ⌘Z clears).
