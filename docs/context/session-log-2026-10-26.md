## Studio responsive breakpoints · plan (approved 2026-10-26: D1–D4 as recommended, D5 no)

The user (2026-10-25): people should see and adjust the desktop / tablet / phone versions of a screen, as in Framer.
Read the Studio and Layout code, weighed per-layer overrides (Framer / Figma Sites), linked Screens, breakpoint
variables, responsive layout props and intrinsic layout. The user chose (2026-10-26): previews side by side + a few
responsive layout props (the Grid `columns` shape) + "Make a separate Screen". Plan:
`docs/research/studio-responsive-breakpoints-2026-10-26.md` (P1–P3, decisions D1–D5, sessions A/B). Finding for P1:
six components follow the window width with `@media`, not their frame's breakpoint. Nothing built yet.
Then (user): P1 is a per-Screen view switch Desktop · Tablet · Mobile (a view through `frameOverrides`, never saved;
edge drags stay real resizes, a desktop Screen's breakpoint follows its width) instead of three frames side by side.
