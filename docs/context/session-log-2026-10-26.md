## UI/UX Pro Max skill · evaluation, then UX principles + product patterns

The user (2026-10-26): research folding the "UI/UX Pro Max" skill (zip, v2.15.0, MIT) into Zen's skills for Figma and
Studio; evaluate it first. Read it in a scratch folder and ran its search on four Zen-like briefs: app briefs came back
as landing patterns with off-domain palettes and fonts (an internal HR dashboard → "Education teal", Victorian
serifs); its UX rows (WCAG 2.2, forms, navigation, charts) are the useful part. Verdict: don't install it (its visual
layer breaks Zen's hard rules); take the UX layer as Zen-owned principles. Plan P1–P5 (ux-principles.md,
product-patterns.md, a robustness pass in design-principles §9, wiring into the Figma AI kit and Zen Agent's prompt):
`docs/research/ui-ux-pro-max-evaluation-2026-10-26.md`.
Then (user): P1–P5 approved without G4 ("Bỏ G4. Phần đó nghiên cứu sau": data-view principles are a later study).
Wrote `skills/zen-component-usage/references/ux-principles.md` (states, forms, navigation, WCAG 2.2, touch, motion;
each item names the Zen part, e.g. Form already focuses the first invalid field, so a long form only adds an
InlineMessage summary) and `product-patterns.md` (13 families → screens, trust, avoid, Figma ◆ / code templates);
design-principles §0 and §9 (push the data, break it on purpose, walk it as a user); the two SKILL.md files; the AI
kit (`kit.mjs`, `aiKit.ts`, kit README/AGENTS); a short block in Zen Agent's prompt. Checks: ai-kit:check 193 ✓,
agent selftest 21 ✓, words ✓, guidelines:check ✓, usage:selftest ✓. Built first in the shared checkout, then moved to
the worktree branch `zen/docs/ux-principles-20261026` at Giám sát's request (no browser gate: docs and two source
lists).
