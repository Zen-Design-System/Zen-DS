## UI/UX Pro Max skill · evaluation, then UX principles + product patterns

The user (2026-10-26): research folding the "UI/UX Pro Max" skill (zip, v2.15.0, MIT) into Zen's skills for Figma and
Studio; evaluate it first. Read it in a scratch folder and ran its search on four Zen-like briefs: app briefs came back
as landing patterns with off-domain palettes and fonts (an internal HR dashboard → "Education teal", Victorian
serifs); its UX rows (WCAG 2.2, forms, navigation, charts) are the useful part. Verdict: don't install it (its visual
layer breaks Zen's hard rules); take the UX layer as Zen-owned principles. Plan P1–P5 (ux-principles.md,
product-patterns.md, a robustness pass in design-principles §9, wiring into the Figma AI kit and Zen Agent's prompt):
`docs/research/ui-ux-pro-max-evaluation-2026-10-26.md`.
Then (user): P1–P5 approved without G4 ("Bỏ G4. Phần đó nghiên cứu sau": data-view principles are a later study).
Wrote `skills/zen-component-usage/references/ux-principles.md` (states, forms, navigation, WCAG 2.2, touch, motion;
each item names the Zen part, e.g. Form already focuses the first invalid field, so a long form only adds an
InlineMessage summary) and `product-patterns.md` (13 families → screens, trust, avoid, Figma ◆ / code templates);
design-principles §0 and §9 (push the data, break it on purpose, walk it as a user); the two SKILL.md files; the AI
kit (`kit.mjs`, `aiKit.ts`, kit README/AGENTS); a short block in Zen Agent's prompt. Checks: ai-kit:check 193 ✓,
agent selftest 21 ✓, words ✓, guidelines:check ✓, usage:selftest ✓. Built first in the shared checkout, then moved to
the worktree branch `zen/docs/ux-principles-20261026` at Giám sát's request (no browser gate: docs and two source
lists).

## dnd E2E rows: DND-03 and DND-05…08 fixed and baselined (tier S; branch zen/fix/studio-dnd-e2e-20261026; PR #308)

Found while #304 recorded the opt-in groups (session-log-2026-10-25, "New E2E rows that break fail the gate"): DND-03
and DND-06 failed alone, DND-07 hung past its 40-min limit, DND-05/08 never ran. Each row, at its owner:
- **DND-03 (product, Segmented):** the screenshot was a blank page; the run's Vite error was "Maximum update depth
  exceeded" (stack in `_shared/phone-sheet.tsx`). Cause: on a phone a full-width Segmented shares its row equally
  (`flex: 1 1 0`), so in a box as wide as its content (CalendarToolbar in a column that does not stretch, a floating
  layer) its widest label is cut → chip row; the chip row (chip padding + gaps) is wider than the segments' sum, which
  was the `needed` width → segments again → cut → … Each ChipGroup mount sets its Chips' breakpoint state, so React's
  limit tripped in phone-sheet. Fix in `Segmented.tsx`: `needed` for full width = widest segment × count; segments
  that come back and are cut at once keep the chips until the chips have more room than that width (no CSS change).
  Regression case in `tests/interaction/segmented-phone-chips.test.tsx` (floating Segmented + CalendarToolbar in a
  `align-items: flex-start` column): on 22548853's Segmented it fails with the same "Maximum update depth exceeded".
- **DND-06 (scenario):** Layers lists the front-most layer first (`data-order="front"`, Figma's order), so a row's upper
  half is after it in the code; the product wrote Text, ListBox, Box, Card, which is right. The "empty Screen's own
  row" no longer exists (the frame row is the Screen's), so the third drag now goes into the middle of the Card's row
  (into the Card, last).
- **DND-07 (scenario):** Layers names a Box "Frame N", so the `/^\s*Box\b/` row filter never matched; each item waited
  out the click and three ⌘Z timeouts (~25 s × 128 items > 40 min, then the retry). The Frame row is now found by its
  layer id (`local:<page>.zen.tsx:<loc>#0`). Measured 10 items in 24 s; the row limit is now 10 min (was 40).
- **DND-05, DND-08:** worked the first time they ran; nothing changed.

Runs (gate slot from Giám sát, main 22548853 merged first):
- `--only=dnd --rows=DND-03,DND-06,DND-08,DND-05 --no-retry`: 4 works, 274 s, no Vite errors.
- `ZEN_DND_LIMIT=10 … --rows=DND-07 --no-retry`: works, 24 s.
- Vitest `segmented-phone-chips` 4/4, plus toast-search-chip-segmented, controls, layout-sizing, chart-card-metric,
  calendar, menu-chip-sheet: 79/79.
- `npm run qa -- --isolated --pages=calendar --files=<3 files>`: PASS (Figma contracts 33 suites for Segmented,
  vitest full suite, audit 1512/390/320 + dark + behaviour 0 new, Studio E2E 363 works in 4 shards). Contact sheets
  segmented/calendar at 390 and 1512 looked the same as before (chips in "Periods on a phone", the full-width switch in
  the phone Calendar toolbar).
- `npm run platform:audit:selftest`: 70 passed (segmented-fit cases included).
- `--only=dnd --update-baseline`: 8 works, 0 broken, 990 s (DND-07 260 s), no Vite errors. The baseline now holds
  DND-01…08; README, run.mjs and dnd.mjs say about 17 minutes for the group.
- Merged main 8ec5baa9 (#306) before the push, then 9c517538 (#311: CHANGELOG and this log kept both sides, #311 first).
