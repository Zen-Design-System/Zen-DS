## Studio Play: desktop full screen + dark popovers (tier S, branch zen/fix/studio-play-desktop-20261026)

The user: "Phần play prototype đang lỗi. Không hiện full màn hình desktop ra", then "lỗi popover trong table không
chuyển sang darkmode khi UI bản play đang là darkmode". Reproduced on the DEMO-MEET page `quan-ly-task` with Playwright on
a private Studio server (a copy of `.zen-studio/pages`).

- **Desktop not full screen.** Play's Auto viewport drew a desktop Screen as a card `min(1440px, 100%)` wide on a 24px
  padded stage with rounded corners (1920 window: 240px gutters each side). Since #288 (10-24) ▷ on a page's Screen
  starts Play instead of Present's full-screen card, so the user met the card where a full screen used to be. Fix
  (`builder/proto/Player.tsx`, `builder.css`): the stage carries `data-viewport` from the viewport asked for (auto when
  no device is simulated, set before the fixed box measures, so its padding never changes under the measure); in Auto
  the stage has no padding and the device is `width: 100%`, `height: 100cqh`, square, no shadow. Fixed viewports
  (devices, typed W × H) keep the padded stage.
- **Popover light in a dark Play.** Play had no `ZenPortalProvider`, so everything that portals through ZenPortal (the
  Table editor layer, icon tooltips, a portalled Chip popover, the ToastStack) went to the Studio's `<body>`, outside the
  layer that carries Play's `data-theme`. Fix: `Player` holds the portal root and wraps the ToastProvider and the layer
  in `ZenPortalProvider`; `PlayLayer` draws `.official-portal-root.studio-portal-root` with Play's modes beside the
  device, as Present does. Not inside the device: a modal opened there (a Side Panel) inerts the device's other
  children (`inertOutside`), and a popover opened from the modal must stay live.
- Checked by script (1512, 1920, 1280 and iPad landscape at 80%): device = the page under the bar; Table popover dark
  (bg 5/255) under its cell, flips above at the bottom of a scaled iPad; Escape closes it and stays in Play; a select in
  the task Side Panel picks; tooltip and toast in the dark layer. Present already had its own portal root.
- E2E rows PT-27 (desktop Auto fills, iPad on the padded stage) and PT-28 (dark Table popover, toast, tooltip, a Table
  popover in a modal Side Panel picks), ids from Giám sát. tsc, studio:selftest, style:check, usage:check pass.
