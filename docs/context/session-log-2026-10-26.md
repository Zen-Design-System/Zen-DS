# Session log 2026-10-26

## bp-library · responsive Layout props (P2 library half of the responsive-breakpoints plan)

Plan: `docs/research/studio-responsive-breakpoints-2026-10-26.md` §2 and §4, approved by the user 2026-10-26 (D5, a
harness rule for hiding on every breakpoint, is not approved: no rule or audit check added). Worktree
`responsive-layout-2b644b`; session bp-studio builds the Studio half. Tier L (Layout renders on every page).

- **`_shared/responsive.ts`:** `Responsive<T>` (`T | { desktop?, tablet?, mobile? }`), `ResponsiveBreakpoint`,
  `resolveAt(value, breakpoint)`: own key, then the wider ones, a narrower key only when no wider one is set (the old
  `columnsAt` order); desktop when no breakpoint is known. Exported from Layout.
- **Layout.tsx:** Stack `direction gap align justify wrap padding paddingX paddingY`, Grid `gap rowGap columnGap padding`,
  Box `padding paddingX paddingY` take `Responsive<…>`; `hideOn` on all three writes `data-hidden="true"`
  (`display: none` in layout.css, element kept). The breakpoint is the frame's own `modes.breakpoint`, else
  `useZen().breakpoint`, else desktop. Stack writes the resolved direction to `data-direction`, so the layout.css sizing
  rules stay as they were.
- **Grid `columns` nested-mode bug confirmed** by the new test (a desktop frame on a mobile page got 1 column, on a tablet
  page 2): the `[data-breakpoint] .zen-grid` descendant rules also matched frames with their own modes. Grid now resolves
  `columns` with `resolveAt`; the two descendant rules are gone and stackBelow's selector is plain again.
- **Test:** `tests/interaction/layout-responsive.test.tsx` (18): resolveAt, Stack/Grid/Box at the three breakpoints,
  hideOn, no provider, nested modes both ways. `npm test`: 92 files, 1402 passed.
- **Docs:** JSDoc per prop; `scripts/build-api.mjs` names the alias (`Responsive<"column" | "row">`) instead of
  react-docgen's raw `T | { … }`; guideline entry (use, api rows Per breakpoint + Hide on, Do: structure per
  breakpoint, sizes from tokens and modes; Don't: hide on every breakpoint); two Layout examples (a row that stacks on
  phones; a panel hidden on phones), each on the page and in a PlatformPhone.
- **AI UI catalog:** `tools/ai-ui/types.mjs` reads `Responsive<X>` as X or `{ desktop, tablet, mobile }` of X (the generic
  alias had turned gap/padding/direction into "anything"); `npm run ai-ui:build`. AGENTS.consumer.md's Layout row names
  the per-breakpoint props and hideOn.
- **Studio compatibility:** `compile-api-build.mjs` `literalUnion` sees through `Responsive<…>` (the generated file is
  unchanged: Stack/Grid/Box keep their LITERAL_PROPS); `propSchema.ts` `editorFor` edits the plain value of a
  `Responsive<X>` (else LayoutSection's ScaleField dropped gap/padding) — told bp-studio.
- **Figma:** `tools/studio/responsive-props.mjs` (isomorphic): push draws each frame at its Screen's breakpoint (phone
  mobile, tablet tablet, desktop by width), a frame's `modes` breakpoint for its layers, leaves out layers hidden there,
  and notes both; Update from Figma (figma-diff) compares and writes only that breakpoint's key (a reset writes the
  prop's default or drops the key), collapses a value equal everywhere to plain, never offers hideOn or a hidden layer
  as removed. The pull itself needs no change (it writes a new page; merging is figma-diff's). Selftests: figma-push
  (+5), figma-diff (+8).
- **Merge order:** bp-studio's PR 1 makes the Studio Screen give its breakpoint through ZenContext. Until it is in main,
  Grid columns and the new props inside a phone Screen on the canvas read the app's desktop breakpoint.
